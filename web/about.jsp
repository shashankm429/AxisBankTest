                        <p align="justify">                               Axis Bank Limited (formerly UTI Bank) is the third largest private sector bank in India. Although classified as a private sector bank, Axis Bank's promoters ( UTI, LIC and GIC, which collectively held approx. 34% of the shares as at 31 December 2013), are all entities owned and controlled by the Government of India.

The bank offers financial services to customer segments covering Large and Mid-Sized Corporates, MSME, Agriculture and Retail Business. Axis Bank has its registered office at Ahmedabad.<br>

                              <p align="justify" class="bodytextheading">History</p>
                              <p align="justify"> UTI Bank opened its registered office in Ahmedabad and corporate office in Mumbai in December 1993. The first branch was inaugurated on 2 April 1994 in Ahmedabad by Dr. Manmohan Singh, then Finance Minister of India. UTI Bank began its operations in 1994, after the Government of India allowed new private banks to be established. The Bank was promoted in 1993 jointly by the Administrator of the Unit Trust of India (UTI-I), Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), General Insurance Corporation, National Insurance Company, The New India Assurance Company, The Oriental Insurance Corporation and United India Insurance Company.

In 2001 UTI Bank agreed to merge with and amalgamate Global Trust Bank, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) withheld approval and nothing came of this. In 2004 the RBI put Global Trust into moratorium and supervised its merger into Oriental Bank of Commerce.

UTI Bank opened its first overseas branch in 2006 Singapore. That same year it opened a representative office in Shanghai, China.

UTI Bank opened a branch in the Dubai International Financial Centre in 2007. That same year it began branch operations in Hong Kong. The next year it opened a representative office in Dubai.

Axis Bank opened a branch in Colombo in October 2011, as a Licensed Commercial Bank supervised by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Also in 2011, Axis Bank opened a representative offices in Abu Dhabi.

In 2013, Axis Bank's subsidiary, Axis Bank UK commenced banking operations. Axis Bank UK has a branch in London.

In 2014, Axis Bank upgraded its representative office in Shanghai to a branch.</p>
